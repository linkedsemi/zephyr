  The linkedsemi LS pin controller is responsible for connecting peripheral outputs
  to specific port/pins (also known as alternate functions) and configures pin properties.

  The pinctrl settings are referenced in a device tree peripheral node. For example in a UART
  node:

  &uart {
      compatible = "linkedsemi,ls-uart";
      pinctrl-0 = <&uart1_tx_pb00 &uart1_rx_pb01>;
      pinctrl-names = "default";
      ...
  };

  The pre-defined nodes only set the alternate function of the output pin. The
  configuration for the pin (i.e. drive strength) should be set in the board setup.
  The set of possible configurations are defined in the properties section below (in addition
  to the inherited property-allowlist list from pincfg-node.yaml).

  To create a new pin configuration, the user may append to the &pinctrl node, for example

  #include <zephyr/dt-bindings/pinctrl/ls-pinctrl.h>
  &pinctrl {
      my_node_config: my_node_config {
      pinmux = <LS_PINMUX_SET(A, 01, ALTERNATE_FUNCTION)>;
        ... other supported pin configurations ..
  };
  where LS_PINMUX_SET(PORT, PIN, ALTERNATE_FUNCTION) is a helper macro for setting the
  alternate function for a given port/pin.

          description: |
            Encodes port/pin and alternate function. See helper macro LS_PINMUX_SET().
            To simplify the usage, macro is available to generate "pinmux" field.
            This macro is available here:
              -include/zephyr/dt-bindings/pinctrl/ls-pinctrl.h
            Some examples of macro usage:
               GPIO A9 set as alernate function UART1_TXD
            ... {
                     pinmux = <LS_PINMUX_SET('A', 9, UART1_TXD)>;
            };
          required: true
          type: int

        drive-strength:
          description: |
            Drive strength of the output pin. Following options as in io_drive_type_t
            See ls_soc_gpio.h. Default to 1/4 max driver.
          type: string
          default: "1/4 max driver"
          enum:
            - "1/4 max driver"          
            - "1/4 max driver"
            - "1/2 max driver"
            - "max driver"
